  "department_p1": "We are the Department of Bioengineering's Social Collaboration Course, named \"Personalized Health and Medical Care Course\". We aim to integrate engineering techniques such as digital data analysis, high-resolution omics analysis of biological information, and AI (artificial intelligence) to refine individual health conditions and present them in a clear, accessible way. By doing so, we provide society with effective tools for preventing the onset and progression of diseases.",
  "department_p2": "Our research involves experts in medical engineering (engineers, physicians, public health nurses, and data scientists) who aim to not only advance medical care but also apply their knowledge to preventive fields in general society—such as corporate health management and well-being. By promoting education and research in this area of medical-engineering collaboration that merges expertise from both fields, we seek to generate a powerful synergistic effect.",

  "har_desc": "Healthy aging research using wearable devices, omics, and genetics integrates real-time physiological monitoring with molecular and genetic insights to understand aging processes. Wearables track vital signs and activity, while omics (e.g., genomics, proteomics, metabolomics) and genetic data help identify biomarkers and risk factors for age-related diseases. Our multidisciplinary approach enables personalized interventions and early disease detection, promoting healthy longevity.",

Leverage these large datasets, we develop ML algorithms to uncover patterns between daily habits—like exercise routines and sleep patterns. We then implemented reinforcement learning and small langauge models to nudge individuals into making targeted habit changes, such as adjusting physical activity levels or optimizing bedtime routines, ultimately improving sleep efficiency and overall life quality.",
