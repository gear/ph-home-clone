                    Social Collaboration Course, named "Personalized 
                    Health and Medical Care Course". We aim to 
                    integrate engineering techniques such as 
                    digital data analysis, high-resolution omics 
                    analysis of biological information, and AI 
                    (artificial intelligence) to refine individual 
                    health conditions and present them in a clear, 
                    accessible way. By doing so, we provide society 
                    with effective tools for preventing the 
                    onset and progression of diseases.`,
    department_p2: `Our research involves experts in medical engineering 
                    (engineers, physicians, public health nurses, and data 
                    scientists) who aim to not only advance medical care 
                    but also apply their knowledge to preventive fields 
                    in general society—such as corporate health management 
                    and well-being. By promoting education and research 
                    in this area of medical-engineering collaboration 
                    that merges expertise from both fields, we seek to 
                    generate a powerful synergistic effect.`,

           real-time physiological monitoring with

           track vital signs and activity,

           and genetic data help identify biomarkers 
           and risk factors for age-related diseases.

                 devices (wrist-worn and ring). Leverage these large datasets, 
                 we develop ML algorithms to uncover patterns between daily 
                 habits—like exercise routines and sleep patterns. We then implemented 
                 reinforcement learning and small langauge models to nudge 
                 individuals into making targeted habit changes, such as 
                 adjusting physical activity levels or optimizing
